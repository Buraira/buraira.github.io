        <h1> Neural Networks</h1>
        <p>I am not going to describe here what a neuron is. But I will write some points about a neuron to 
        get a better understand on neural network.
            <ol>
                <li>A neuron has dendrites as input signals and axons as output signals.</li>
                <li>It has a main body for funtions.</li>
                <li>Neuron transmits electrical signals within each other and odes functions to perform tasks on
                the whole body using those three things.</li>
            </ol>
            In neural networks there are 3 layers.
            <ol>
                <li>input layer</li>
                <li>hidden layer</li>
                <li>output layer</li>
            </ol>

            <br> The hidden layer may be of multiple numbers. In the each layer there are bias units with value
            of 1. The hidden layer nodes are called activation unit <i> a<sub>i</sub><sup>(j)</sup></i>.
            We have to calculate the activation function to go to the next layer.
