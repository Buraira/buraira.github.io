        <h1> Week 2 </h1>
        <p>In our last week we have learned about some very basics of machine learning. Week 2
        is about <br>
        <ol>
            <li>How to set up enviroment</li>
            <li>Linear Regression with Multiple Variables </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Set up enviroment</h3>
        <p>In this part the video slides are about<br>
        <ol>
            <li> How to install and setup Octave an Matlab </li>
            <li> Some basic tutorials on Octave and Matlan </li>
            <li> How to submit assignments </li>
        </ol>
    From week 2 we have to submit programming assignments as well.

        <h3> Linear Regression with Multiple Variables </h3>
        <p>In our last week we learnt Linear Regression with single variable. This week we get to
        learn linear Regression with multiple varibles.</p>
        <p>This is also called 'multivariate linear regression'. In this case the hypothesis will
        be like <br>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><i> h(θ) = θ₀ + θ₁x₁ + θ₂x₂ + ..... + θ<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub>
        </i>
        </p>
        <p>For multivariate linear regression we have to calculate gradient descent for n times. </p>
