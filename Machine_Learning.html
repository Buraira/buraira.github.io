      <h1 style = "font-size:300%"><b>Week 1</b></h1>
     <p>In week one I have learnt about:
            <ul>
                <li>What is Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                <li>Model Representation and Cost Function </li>
                <li>Gradient Descent</li>
                <li>Linear Algebra in Machine Learning</li>
     
              </ul>
     </p>
     <h3> What is Machine Learning</h3> 

      <p> There were two definitions given for Machine Learning, I like the one of Tom Mitchells: 
      "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T
      and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
      experience E."
      <br>
      Example: playing checkers. <br>
      E = the experience of playing many games of checkers <br>
      T = the task of playing checkers. <br>
      P = the probability that the program will win the next game. </p>

      <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
      <p> In Supervised Learning we know the output , so all we have to do is to make a relationship between the        output and the given dataset.
      There are two types of SL. Regression an classification.<br>
      Regression is where we have continuous outputs an we have to predict the result form this. For example,
      Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price.
      Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.<br>
      Classification, on the other hand, is classifiying the output into some options. For ecample, sells for
      more or less than the asking experience.<br>
      <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
      <p>In UL we get know idea how the output will be. So we have to predict the result by clustering the data 
      based on relationships among the variables in the data.<br>
      Clustering (i.e. grouping genes)and Non-clustering (i.e. finding structure in chaotic environment) are two
      types of UL.</p>
      <h3>Model Representaion and Cost Function </h3>
      <p><b>Model representation</b> is the way to represent a problem and it's solution.
      Our first model representation algorithm or learning algorithm is Linear Regression to predict results for 
      supervised learning algorithms.
      Here we use <i>x<sup>(i)</sup></i> as input variable (also called input feature) and <i>y<sup>(i)</sup></i>
      as the predicted output.</p> 
      <p>A pair of <i>(x<sup>(i)</sup>,y<sup>(i)</sup>)</i> is called a training example. And the data set we
         use for learning , a list of m traing examples i.e <i> i = 1,2,.....,m</i> is called a training set. 
         We learn  the hypothesis function <i>h(x) where h = X->Y</i> to predict a corresponding result. 
         When the value of <i>y </i> is continuous it's regression problem and when <i>y</i> is discrete then it
         is classification problem.<br>
        <b>Cost Function</b> is to measure the accuracy of our hypothesis.

        J(θ<sub>0</sub>,θ<sub>1</sub>)=1/2m +Z<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup>y<sup>i</sup>−y<sup>i</sup>
        )2S=1/2m+Z(i=1,m) (hθ(x<sup>i</sup>)−y<sup>i</sup>)2S;
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
