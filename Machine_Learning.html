      <h1 style = "font-size:300%"><b>Week 1</b></h1>
     <p>In week one I have learnt about:
            <ul>
                <li>What is Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                <li>Gradient Descent</li>
                <li>Linear Algebra in Machine Learning</li>
     
              </ul>
     </p>
     <h2> What is Machine Learning</h2> 

      <p> There were two definitions given for Machine Learning, I like the one of Tom Mitchells: 
      "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T
      and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
      experience E."
      <br>
      Example: playing checkers. <br>
      E = the experience of playing many games of checkers <br>
      T = the task of playing checkers. <br>
      P = the probability that the program will win the next game. </p>

      <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
      <p> In Supervised Learning we know the output , so all we have to do is to make a relationship between the        output and the given dataset.
      There are two types of SL. Regression an classification.<br>
      Regression is where we have continuous outputs an we have to predict the result form this. For example,
      Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price.
      Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.<br>
      Classification, on the other hand, is classifiying the output into some options. For ecample, sells for
      more or less than the asking experience.<br>
      <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
