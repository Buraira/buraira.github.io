      <h1 style = "font-size:300%"><b>Week 1</b></h1>
     <p>In week one I have learnt about:
            <ul>
                <li>What is Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                <li>Gradient Descent</li>
                <li>Linear Algebra in Machine Learning</li>
     
              </ul>
     </p>
     <h2> What is Machine Learning</h2> 

      <p> There were two definitions given for Machine Learning, I like the one of Tom Mitchells: 
      "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T
      and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
      experience E."

      Example: playing checkers.

      E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

      T = the task of playing checkers.

      P = the probability that the program will win the next game. </p>
